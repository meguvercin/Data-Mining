# IE 252 Final Report

## Abstract
This report presents the findings of our data mining project, focusing on author classification and text analysis. We utilized machine learning techniques to predict authors based on text content and extracted relevant tags from articles. Our methodology involved preprocessing text data, training an SVM model, and evaluating its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying authors and extracting meaningful tags.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a system capable of classifying authors based on their writing styles and extracting relevant tags from their articles. This system can be applied in various fields, including literature analysis, content recommendation, and plagiarism detection. The project leverages data mining techniques to analyze text data and make predictions.

## Literature Review
Previous studies in author classification have utilized various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. These studies have shown that text preprocessing and feature extraction are crucial for improving classification accuracy. Additionally, tag extraction has been explored in the context of content management systems and social media platforms.

## Methodology
Our methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: We collected articles from multiple authors and stored them in a structured format.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: We cleaned the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
3. **Feature Extraction**: We used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: We trained an SVM model on the preprocessed data.
5. **Evaluation**: We evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and precision metrics.

## Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 85% in author classification. The tag extraction process successfully identified relevant keywords from the articles, enhancing the overall analysis.

## Discussion
The results indicate that our approach is effective in classifying authors and extracting meaningful tags. However, there are limitations, such as the need for more diverse data and potential improvements in preprocessing techniques.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our project demonstrates the potential of data mining techniques in author classification and tag extraction. Future work could focus on enhancing the model's performance and expanding the dataset to include more authors and articles.
